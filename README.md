# Deep-Learning-1

This repository contains homework assignments and the final project completed as a part of my deep learning course in graduate school. For more information on what each assignment was concerned with, information can be provided on request.

### [Final Project](https://github.com/rohitpenumarti/Deep-Learning-1/tree/master/Final-Project)

For the final project, I used deep learning to create a content-based recommendation system for movies. For the model, I used the description of the movie, the main actors, the director, genres, and keywords. I used a CBOW model to generate the text embeddings and I used cosine similarity to measure the similarities between given movies to recommend the best one given the user profile.
